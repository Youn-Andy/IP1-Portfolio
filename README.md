This website is designed by Philip Andrew Okoth.

This website contains a brief explanation of my background and a few things I enjoy doing.
It is written in html and css.

The website contains an index page that has a link to other projects thatI have worked on over the past week.
It also contains an about me page that describes my life hood from my education background to why I love coding to the things I enjoy doing.
